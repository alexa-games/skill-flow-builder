create, edit, and preview content for your skill. The SFB Editor is a
cross-platform desktop application built using the [Electron framework](https://www.electronjs.org/)
using React and Redux. This package contains the source code for the SFB editor.

## Getting Started

First, clone the parent repository.

git clone https://github.com/alexa-games/skill-flow-builder.git && cd skill-flow-builder/
```

The SFB Editor requires that the core modules are built, build all the packages
in the `packages/` directory by running `yarn build-modules`.

Navigate into the `sfb-editor/` directory with `cd packages/sfb-editor/`,
and run `yarn install && yarn start`. This should conclude launching the editor.

## Package Structure

The SFB Editor package structure looks like this, with most of the editor source
code existing inside the `app/` directory.

The SFB Editor is an Electron application. The Electron framework is based on
Node.js and Chromium, and it enables you to write rich cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Read more about Electron applications
[here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs).

## Contributing

The SFB Editor is mainly built using [React](https://reactjs.org/docs) and the
[Electron framework](https://www.electronjs.org/docs). After editing a view or
component, visualize your changes by simply rebuilding with yarn build and
relaunching the editor with `yarn start`. For example, a change to the application
sidebar would require changes in `app/AppRail/index.js` or `app/AppRail/styles.css`,
with the changes being shown next rebuild.
