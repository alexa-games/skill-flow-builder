        Here's a conversation between a few friends.
        // <voice name="Kendra"><amazon:effect name="whispered">I want to tell you a secret.</amazon:effect></voice>
        // <voice name="Kendra"><lang xml:lang="en-US"><amazon:effect name="whispered">I want to tell you a secret.</amazon:effect></lang></voice>
        <amazon:effect name='whispered'>I want to tell you a secret.</amazon:effect>
        <voice name='Brian'>Okay, I'm listening.</voice>
        <voice name='Kendra'><lang xml:lang='en-US'>Americans say, advertisement, and barbecue.</lang></voice>
        <voice name='Kendra'><lang xml:lang='en-GB'>British people say, advertisement, and barbecue. How do you say it?</lang></voice>
        // check to make sure pronunciation is correct on these two statements
        <voice name='Brian'><lang xml:lang='en-GB'>I say advertisement, and, barbecue.</lang></voice>
        <voice name='Brian'><lang xml:lang='en-US'>But I can also say it your way.  Advertisement, barbecue. See?</lang></voice>
        
        // "pea-con" or "pee-can" (voice + phoneme tag)
        <voice name='Justin'>Do you say, <phoneme alphabet='ipa' ph='pɪˈkɑːn'>pecan</phoneme>, or, <phoneme alphabet='ipa' ph='ˈpi.kæn'>pecan</phoneme>?</voice>
        
        // Should pronounce - I want to "reed", but I've already "red"
        <voice name='Ivy'>
        I want to <w role=amazon:VBD>read</w> a new book, but I've already <w role='amazon:VB'>read</w> everything in the library! That didn't sound right, lets try that again.
        I want to <w role='amazon:VB'>read</w> a new book, but I've already <w role='amazon:VBD'>read</w> everything in the library! Much better!
        </voice>
        

    *then
        -> end
