# Set up Amazon Polly voices

By default, you can use [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) voices
with Alexa [SSML](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference.html)
without further setup of Amazon Polly. You must perform additional setup only
if you want to use advanced voice-mixing features like background music.

## Step 1: Set up the required AWS IAM permissions

### CloudFormation

If you are using the Lambda Deployer deploy option, skip this step and start
from [here](#lambda-deployer).

If you are using CloudFormation to deploy, ensure that the following permissions
to your CloudFormation `skill-stack.yaml` that is used by the IAM role for your
AWS Lambda function. By default, these permissions are already included.

- `s3:GetObject` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `s3:PutObject` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `s3:PutObjectAcl` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `polly:SynthesizeSpeech` for using the Amazon Polly service to generate the
sound file using the Amazon Polly voices.

Example:

```json
- Effect: Allow
  Action:
    - s3:GetObject
    - s3:PutObject
    - s3:PutObjectAcl
    - polly:SynthesizeSpeech
  Resource:
    - ...
```

### Lambda Deployer

If you are deploying using CloudFormation, skip to
[Step 2](#step-2-set-up-amazon-s3-bucket). If you are using the Lambda deployer
deploy option, add the following permissions to your custom IAM policy called
"SFBLambda" that is used by the IAM role for your AWS Lambda function:

- `s3:GetObject` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `s3:PutObject` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `s3:PutObjectAcl` for storing and caching the generated sound files.
- `polly:SynthesizeSpeech` for using the Amazon Polly service to generate the
sound file using the Amazon Polly voices.

Example:

```json
"s3": "GetObject"
"s3": "PutObject"
"s3": "PutObjectAcl"
"polly": "SynthesizeSpeech"
```

## Step 2: Set up Amazon S3 bucket

- When you create and set up the bucket, make sure to clear the following public
access options:
  - **Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects.** When you clear this
  option you can add objects that you customers can see. The sound files used by
  the skill must be public-readable.
  - **Remove public access granted through public ACLs.** When you clear this
  option your customers can access the public objects.

## Step 3: Configure your skill

The default Alexa SSML syntax supports voice tags. With the tags you can use
custom Amazon Polly voices in your skill without additional setup.

For example, to use Amazon Polly to mix voices with background music, you need
to set up a few configurable properties. Otherwise, you can use Amazon Polly
voices alone while leaving `polly-config` disabled. The configuration file for
the Skill Flow Builder is at `<your_project_path>/abcConfig.json`.

To configure your skill set up the following configurable properties:

- `"s3-bucket-name"`: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket to store the generated
sound files.
- `"s3-domain-name"`: Name of the domain where your Amazon S3 files are served.
Usually "s3.amazonaws.com" for all global buckets, but if using a regionalized
bucket, you need to provide the correct value.
- `"polly-config -> enabled"`: If true, calls Amazon Polly instead of using
the built-in `<voice>` tag functionality provided via Alexa SSML.
- `"polly-config -> combineAudioTags"`: If true, combines multiple audio
files into a single `.mp3` file.
- `"polly-config -> dontUseCache"`: If true, calls the Amazon Polly
service for every request. If false, the skill tries to use the previously
generated sound files if already generated.
- `"default-narrator -> enabled"`: If true, the narrator's voice is changed
to the Amazon Polly voice instead of Alexa's default voice.
- `"default-narrator -> name"`: Amazon Polly name of the default narrator's voice
as shown in the [voice list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).
- `"default-narrator -> pitch"`: Pitch shift of the default voice. Set to
"+0%" to use the default pitch.
- `"default-narrator -> rate"`: Rate/speed shift of the default voice.
Set to "+0%" to use the default rate.
