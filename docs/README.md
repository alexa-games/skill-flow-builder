# Understand the Skill Flow Builder

The Skill Flow Builder development suite helps you create narrative-driven skills
more quickly. It includes a Skill Flow Builder Editor application for designers
and writers, and a Visual Studio Code extension for developers. Designers and
writers can quickly prototype and modify content. In parallel, developers can
build differentiated features and minimize time spent on content changes. The
tools share a source file format, which helps make hand-offs between teams more
efficient.

## Skill Flow Builder Editor

Using the Skill Flow Builder Editor, designers and writers can visualize the
built-in story tree. Skill Flow Builder structures the narrative as a series of
connected scenes, which you can navigate with the click of a button. Without
involving a development team, you can write or update the narrative, add visuals
and sound effects, and implement game logic. Assign Amazon Polly voices to
specific characters, add images, and add background audio.

Use the built-in simulator to preview, demo, and test your content. When
finished, export and share a Skill Flow Builder format (.abc) file with your
development team, or export text for narration or localization.

## Skill Flow Builder Core

For developers, Skill Flow Builder offers a command line interface, content
debugger, integration with existing developer tools, and extension support.
With Skill Flow Builder, you can use tools like the Alexa Skills Kit SDKs, ASK
Command Line Interface (ASK CLI), and the AWS CLI. Skill Flow Builder integrates
with extensions for Alexa Presentation Language (APL) templates and in-skill
purchasing, which saves you implementation time.

When you receive a new Skill Flow Builder format (.abc) file from designers and
writers, you can deploy and validate the content as a skill before touching the
code. You can also implement business logic directly in the .abc file by using
the built-in scripting ability called scene instructions.

The content debugger helps isolate debugging process from the content. You can
view variables used, save state for later testing, and view content execution steps.
